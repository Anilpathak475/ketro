# ketro
This is a Retrofit response wrapper written in Kotlin that can be used to easily wrap REST API response to LiveData and exception/error
handling both from the retrofit calls all the way to displaying an error in the view. Ketro allows and encourages the addition of custom exceptions
so errors can easily be grouped and managed with adequate actions and feedback to your app users.
